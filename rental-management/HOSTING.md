# Hosting the web app

The app is a static Vite single-page application. Deploy it to any static host that supports SPA rewrites; `public/_redirects` covers Netlify-compatible hosts and `vercel.json` covers Vercel.

## Build settings

- Install command: `npm ci`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Node.js: 20.19+ or 22.12+

## Netlify deployment

The repository-root `netlify.toml` sets `rental-management` as the base directory, runs `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`, and publishes `dist` relative to that directory. The explicit installation step uses the committed lockfile and includes the development dependencies required by TypeScript and Vite, including for CLI deployments where dependencies have not already been installed. Deploy from the repository root so Netlify reads this configuration. The existing `public/_redirects` supplies the single-page application routing fallback.

Set the hosting environment variables below in Netlify before deploying. A successful production deployment is required for these settings to take effect.

For another static host, configure unknown application routes to return `/index.html` with HTTP 200. This is needed for direct visits to `/tenant` and `/portal`.

## Hosting environment variables

Configure these variables in the host's build environment:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_MPESA_RENT_PAYBILL`

These are Vite build-time values; rebuild and redeploy after changing them. The publishable key is intended for browser use. Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, Daraja consumer secrets, or the M-Pesa callback token in frontend environment variables.

## Supabase Auth URLs

After the first deployment, copy the site's HTTPS origin, such as `https://your-app.example.com`, then open Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:

1. Set **Site URL** to the production origin.
2. Add the production origin to **Redirect URLs** (for example, `https://your-app.example.com/**`).
3. Keep `http://localhost:5173/**` and `http://localhost:5175/**` as additional URLs for local development, if required.

Staff invitations now redirect to the origin currently serving the app, and password recovery does the same. Supabase must allow that origin in **Redirect URLs**. The invitation page consumes the Supabase invite token and lets the invited staff member set a password.

## Supabase backend

The static host only serves the frontend. Keep the Supabase database and Edge Functions in the linked Supabase project. Use [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for schema and function setup. After applying `supabase/user_hierarchy.sql`, redeploy the hierarchy-enforcing account function:

```powershell
npx supabase functions deploy admin-manage-user
```

Test the deployed invite link before inviting the wider team. Configure/register Safaricom callbacks only after the app is public on HTTPS and the approved Paybill and production Daraja credentials are ready.
